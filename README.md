# Cached treeview
Cached treeview allows controlling of a large hierarchical database. Supports the following actions "upload to cache" then "rename node", "remove node", "add node".
After working with cache all changes can be saved in the original database.
# User interface
The user interface contains two treeviews. The right treeview presents the original database and the left one is cache.

Use the right mouse button to open the context menu on both treeviews. Button "Save" saves all changes in the cache to database. Button "Reset" returns treeviews to the default states.
